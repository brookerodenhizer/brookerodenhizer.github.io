title: What Helped Me Understand React.js

<p>As I was studying vanilla Javascript, I never thought I would have as much of a hard time as I did.  I got through it.  Barely!  Then I was introduced to the Javascript framework, ReactJS.  I was relieved when I started learning it because it seemed so much more "coder friendly."  Then I started learning about state and props.  This really tripped me up.</p>
<p>If you have read any other blog of mine, you know that coding did not come as easily as I thought it would.  It is my hope that a newbie coder stumbles across this meager blog portfolio and is put a little at ease that they are not alone.
</p>
<p>So, back to ReactJS.  At first, learning React was a breath of fresh air.  I could actually understand the concepts much more easily than vanilla Javascript and JQuery.  I like how data in the application flows in a single direction.  Data only flows from parent to child.  Unidirectional data flow keeps it simple, right?  NO!  This is because of state versus props.  </p>
